<h1>Convolutional Neural Network</h1>
<br/>

The CNN is deep learning algorithm which is designed to work with images and videos. Here, the algorithm takes images and videos as input, learns and extracts the special features of the image and then classifies based on learned features.

Layers of a CNN Model:
   1. Input model
   2. Convolutional Model + Activation Function
   3. Pooling Layer
   4. Fully Connected Layer
